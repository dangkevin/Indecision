# Indecision

<p> Indecision is a React.js application built with the idea of taking some user entered options and randomly selecting an outcome for you! Indecision was built entirely using React, Webpack, Babel and SASS. </p>


<p> This application was built while working with Andrew Mead's "The Complete React Developer Course with Redux" on Udemy. </p>
